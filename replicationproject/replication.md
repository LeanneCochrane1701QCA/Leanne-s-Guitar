# Assessment 1: Replication project

*Fill out the following workbook with information relevant to your project.*

*Markdown reference:* [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](http://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

## Replication project choice ##
I chose to replicate the Guitar Project

## Related projects ##
*Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the* `replicationproject` *folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing, updating the number* `1` *in the subtitle for each.*

### Related project 1 ###
Musical Instrument

This project is related to mine because it uses the same materials to operate and make the music, it does differ in the code it uses.

### Related project 2 ###
Sound

This project is related to mine because again it uses the same technology to make noise, although it does use a different type of code.

### Related project 3 ###
Air-guitar

https://codesg.imda.gov.sg/air-guitar/

![Image](https://github.com/LeanneCochrane1701QCA/Leanne-s-Guitar/blob/master/codesgimdagovsgairguitar.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it uses similar materies to make it work and this one uses a lot of code I wasn't aware existed until I made my own project and did the research.

### Related project 4 ###
Touch Arpeggiator

https://make.techwillsaveus.com/microbit/activities/touch-arpeggiator

![Image](https://github.com/LeanneCochrane1701QCA/Leanne-s-Guitar/blob/master/Touch%20arpeggiator.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it uses similar parts to make it work, they have added in an extra step by using fruit and a persons hand to change the way the project works, it changes the flow of the current.

### Related project 5 ###
Air Guitar

https://make.techwillsaveus.com/microbit/activities/air-guitar

![Image](https://github.com/LeanneCochrane1701QCA/Leanne-s-Guitar/blob/master/maketechwillsaveus.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it uses the same parts, however, this project has used a proper diy speaker kit instead of headphones.

### Related project 6 ###
Micro:Bit Air Guitar

https://www.stuff.tv/features/how-masterthe-bbc-microbit/intermediate-1-microbit-air-guitar

![Image](https://github.com/LeanneCochrane1701QCA/Leanne-s-Guitar/blob/master/stufftvfeatureshowmasterthebbcmicrobit.jpg)

This project is related to mine because it uses the same parts and again this one uses a more technical speaker system to play the music.

## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

*What I thought before: Describe something that you thought or believed before you read the source that was challenged by the reading.*

*What I learned: Describe what you now know or believe as a result of the reading. Don't just describe the reading: write about what changed in YOUR knowledge.*

*What I would like to know more about: Describe or write a question about something that you would be interested in knowing more about.*

*How this relates to the project I am working on: Describe the connection between the ideas in the reading and one of your current projects or how ideas in the reading could be used to improve your project.*


## Interaction flowchart ##
*Draw a flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible.*

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*
