### Experiment name ###

Experiment 1 Say "Hello" to the BBC Micro:bit!

This is a picture of experiment 1

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was? This was all new to me, this was the first time I had ever even looked at a BBC microbit.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a welcome sign for a shop.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 2 Using a Light Sensor and Analog Inputs

This is showing one view of experiment 2

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was if you put the resistor in the wrong way around your experiment does not work.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as letting you know if it is sunny outside.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 3 Dimming and LED Using a Potentiometer

#### Photo of completed project ####

Here is a picture of Experiment 3

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was that you need to make sure all the wires are in firmly.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a lightswitch in a room that dims itself depending on how much light is in the room already.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 4 Using a Transisitor to Drive a Motor

#### Photo of completed project ####

A picture of Experiment 4 with the code included

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was you really need to be persistent sometimes, I tried everything on this project to get it to work, pulled apart and put back together, in the end it was the fan wires into the terminal connector that was loose.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a handheld fan.

### Experiment name ###

Experiment 5 Using the Accelerometer to Control Motor Speed

#### Photo of completed project ####


![Image](https://github.com/LeanneCochrane1701QCA/Experiments/blob/master/Experiment%205%20working.jpg)

This is experiment 5 working

#### Reflection ####

In this experiment, something new to me was or something I learned was that you really need to read the whole experiment well before you get going or you can waste hours trying to work out what is wrong with the experiment and wondering why it doesn't work when all you need to do is lift up the BBC and it starts working.

This experiment could be the basis of a real world application such as a games console remote control.
